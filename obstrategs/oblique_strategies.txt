Accept advice.
Accretion.
Ask your body.
Balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle.
Be extravagant.
[Blank white card]
Breathe more deeply.
Convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element.
Courage.
Cut a vital connection.
Distorting time.
Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do.
Don't be frightened to display your talents.
Emphasize differences.
From nothing to more than nothing.
Ghost echoes.
Give way to your worst impulse.
Go outside. Shut the door.
Honor thy error as a hidden intention.
Imagine the piece as a set of disconnected events.
In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly
Is there something missing?
Just carry on.
Left channel, right channel, centre channel.
Look at the order in which you do things.
Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them.
Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list.
Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic.
The most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten.
Mute and continue.
(-nobility of, -humility of, -credibility of) Intentions.
Once the search is in progress, something will be found
Only a part, not the whole.
Remember those quiet evenings.
Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities.
Reverse.
Short circuit (If eating peas improves virility, shovel them into your pants).
Take a break.
Take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance
Trust in the you of now.
Use an unacceptable color.
What are the sections sections of? Imagine a caterpillar moving.
What mistakes did you make last time?
What would your closest friend do?
Work at a different speed.
